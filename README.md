# TRS Robotics Control and Automation

1. Designed a simulation robot named KUKA youBot that was able to pick up specified object from the table and drop it in the specified basket.
2. Established the simulation scenario with V-rep and connected it to the programs in MATLAB through the remote interface for youBot manipulation.
3. Overall programming including motion control, path planning, visual processing, robotic grasping and manipulation; completed the entire design structure by combing the code structure of finite-state machine (FSM).
